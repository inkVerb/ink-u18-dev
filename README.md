# Legacy version, no longer in development

This is a legacy version meant to run on Ubuntu 18.04. Development did not continue in Ubuntu 20.04 where `snap` was overriding `apt` and `apt-get` installer package commands. In January 2021, development moved to Arch and Manjaro frameworks. That project is available at the former repo for this original project: [inkVerb/ink-dev](https://github.com/inkVerb/ink-dev).

The day you sue us for how someone uses this software is the day that a bank can sue the car manufacturer of the bank robber's getaway vehicle.

## Basic info
The ink repo contains install packages for Verber™ "serfs" that install web apps
The "repo" is the directory linked to the domain for the inkget serfer (link it with the repolink knight)

While the Verber™ web server uses "serfs" (bash scripts for Linux) to do various jobs, the ink repo server uses "knights".

A "knight" is basically a "serf", but on the ink repo server. This is to avoid confusion.

## Note on Updates
Note: Update version numbers reference the framework. Ongoing updates continue for the knights, etc job scripts. Framework needs rated, sequential alteration, which is why "version" numbers apply to them. Any update will update job scripts, regardless of the current version number.
