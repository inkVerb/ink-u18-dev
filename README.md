## Basic info
The ink repo contains install packages for Verber™ "serfs" that install web apps
The "repo" is the directory linked to the domain for the inkget serfer (link it with the repolink knight)

While the Verber™ web server uses "serfs" (bash scripts for Linux) to do various jobs, the ink repo server uses "knights".

A "knight" is basically a "serf", but on the ink repo server. This is to avoid confusion.

## Note on Updates
Note: Update version numbers reference the framework. Ongoing updates continue for the knights, etc job scripts. Framework needs rated, sequential alteration, which is why "version" numbers apply to them. Any update will update job scripts, regardless of the current version number.
